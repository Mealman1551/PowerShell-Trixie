 This is PowerShell for Debian Trixie. This is a temporary port until Microsoft adds support for PowerShell on Debian 13

## How to install and remove

Run `install.sh` to install, this uses the Meal Installer, a Bash installer that i will also use for other software i make.

For removal use `remove.sh`

## Usage

After installing you can type:
```bash
pwsh
```

## Downloads

Download [PowerShell 7.3.4 for Trixie](https://github.com/Mealman1551/PowerShell-Trixie/raw/refs/heads/main/pwsh-linux-x64.tar.gz)

## Info

I builded PowerShell 7.3.4 on Debian 12 and ported it to Debian 13 Trixie, PowerShell is as of date (6-10-2025) not supported on Debian 13, so i hope that this build will satisfy your needs.
